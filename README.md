# MAC Format

A utility to format MAC addresses from clipboard to the standard colon-separated format.

## Description

MAC Format is a simple yet useful tool that converts raw MAC addresses (e.g., `001A2B3C4D5E`) to the standard colon-separated format (e.g., `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`). It reads from your clipboard and automatically formats the address.

## Features

- ✅ Converts raw MAC addresses to colon-separated format
- ✅ Clipboard integration - reads from and writes to clipboard
- ✅ Fast and lightweight
- ✅ Simple one-click operation

## Usage

1. Copy a MAC address to your clipboard (raw format without colons)
2. Run the MAC Format utility (F10)
3. The formatted MAC address is copied back to your clipboard
4. Paste the formatted address wherever needed

## Supported Input Formats

- `001A2B3C4D5E` → `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`
- `00-1A-2B-3C-4D-5E` → `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`
- `001a2b3c4d5e` → `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E` (case-insensitive)

## Requirements

- Windows system (if AutoHotkey script)
- AutoHotkey v1.1 or later (depending on implementation)

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Run the executable or script
3. Use the clipboard integration to format MAC addresses

## Examples

```
Input:  001A2B3C4D5E
Output: 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E

Input:  001a2b3c4d5e
Output: 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E
```

## How It Works

The utility:
1. Reads the clipboard content
2. Converts it to the standard colon-separated format and changes to uppercase when needed
3. Copies the result back to the clipboard
